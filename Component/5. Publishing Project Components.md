#Publishing Project Components

Our whole front-end framework is built around utilising components. The ethos being to "use more - write less", code. If one project has a specific component that could be used in your current project, use it as it is or build upon it.

#### Published components

Published components are 'published' to a github repo when the use of these components could benefit other or future projects.

Say for instance you are building and styling a 'Twitter Feed' for your project and you feel that this might be a component that should should also be used in existing projects (or future projects) then this component should be published so that its easy to share and integrate.

#### Local components

If you component is so specific to your project then its probably not worth publishing, and would most likely just need to be referenced as a local component.

For instance, say your building a component for 'promo' for your project. We'll call this component **my-promo**.

**my-promo** is very specific to your project. It's most likely that it wont be used by other projects, so theres really no point in making it available to share. So you would just keep this as a local component.

Local components still have component.json file, so at anytime this component becomes of use to another project, it can easily be published to a repo.


```
// my-promo/index.css

.promo {
  background: green;
  color: white;
}
```

```
// my-promo/component.json

{
  "name": "my-promo",
  "description": "Styles for a promo",
  "dependencies": {},
  "styles": [
    "index.css"
  ]
}
```
**Note**: the `boot/component.json` file will need a reference to your local component inside of its "local" array, e.g.

```
// boot/component.json

{
  ...
  "local": [
    "my-promo"
  ],
  ...
}

```

Sometimes it's worth just keeping all new project components as local, until you've completely finished developing them. It can be a bit of a pain and 'bottleneck' having to update, add, commit a changes to a published component during development. **Until it's ready to be shared, keep it local**.


### Publishing components to a Github repo.

So by now you should know if your component should be published or not.
Be sure to ask yourself "**Will any other projects use this**?".

All of our components are published to a Github repo. Why Github? Component itself works best with github. It makes installing components a breeze.

If there aren't any repos associated with your project already, you will need to create them following these very simple guidelines.

Name your repo **projectName-styles** for CSS components, and **projectName-components** for JS components (replacing *projectName* with your actual projects name). If your component has a combination of both, it should live in the 'components' repo.

Although we do not have the separation of style and script components in our project, having the separation in repos means we can easily find components, and we can prevent name clashing by publishing styles and scripts for a 'Dialog' component however not force another FED to download these resources.

**Note**: Once you have created a repo for your project be sure to **add your FED colleagues as collaborators**. You can do this by clicking on `settings > collaborators` in your repo.

### Pull Requests

We all want to produce great code. Code that works, and code that follows best practices. Pull requests can help us do this.

When updating a published component it can benefit to have another persons eyes run over the code. Before pushing the code directly to the projects repo you should **Fork** the component to your own personal github repo.

Simply click the **Fork** button on the components repo page and select to fork it to your private account. You'll now have a personal copy of the component to work with.

You can now add your changes and commit to this repo.
Once you have tested your changes you can request the update to be merged into the component.

On the Github page of your component click **Pull Request**. Then click on **New Pull Request** to publish notes about your update. This PR (Pull Request) and its differentials will now become visible to all FEDs on the original Github repo.

You can now discuss with a colleague about the code via comments on the PR, or in person. We should document as much feedback in the PR comments so we all benefit from the feedback.

Once changes have been viewed and no issues have been found, a PR can be closed and merged into the origin repo. You can then also delete your personal version of this github component if you wish.
